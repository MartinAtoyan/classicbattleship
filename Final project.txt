Final project


You will build a simplified version of the Classic Battleship game with the following ship configuration:
* 1 ship of size 4
* 2 ships of size 3
* 3 ships of size 2
* 4 ships of size 1
Important rule: ships must not touch each other, even diagonally.
Your repository root should look roughly like this:
├─ main.py
├─ data/
│  ├─ player_ships.csv
│  ├─ bot_ships.csv
│  ├─ game_state.csv
├─ src/
│  ├─ ship_input.py
│  ├─ bot_generation.py
│  ├─ gameplay.py
│  └─ utils.py
├─ outputs/
│  └─ (any logs or additional result files)
├─ requirements.txt
└─ README.md


Requirements:
main.py is the entry point. After installing the requirements I should be able to run python main.py and everything happens automatically. Inside main.py, you must:
Part 1 — Player Ship Input (src/ship_input.py)
Write a script that:
1. Reads ship positions from user input (in any format you choose—free-form, coordinates list, grid, etc.).
2. Validates the input:
   * Ships must have correct sizes (4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)
   * Ships must be inside the 10×10 board.
   * Ships cannot touch each other (even diagonally).
   * Saves the valid ship placement into data/player_ships.csv
3.  The CSV format is free-form, but must clearly represent ship coordinates.


Part 2 — Bot Ship Generation (src/bot_generation.py)
Write a script that:
1. Automatically generates a valid random ship layout for the bot.
2. It must follow all rules:
   * No adjacency
   * No going outside the board
   * Ship counts and sizes must be correct
   * Saves the bot layout to: data/bot_ships.csv
3.  Should be the same format as player_ships.csv.
This ensures the bot and the player use compatible formats.


Part 3 — Game State Tracking (src/gameplay.py)
You must create a continuously updated CSV file tracking all moves: data/game_state.csv


This file must contain (at minimum):
* turn number
* player move (coordinate + hit/miss)
* bot move (coordinate + hit/miss)
* state of all cells after the move
A few important rules:
3.1 Display Game State After Each Move
Every time a move is made:
1. Update the CSV.
2. Print a visual 10×10 board to the terminal for both players:
   * Hits
   * Misses
   * Unknown cells
3.2 Marking Terrain After a Ship Is Destroyed
If a ship is fully destroyed:
* All surrounding cells (8 directions) must automatically be marked as miss in the game state.
* These marks must also be reflected in the CSV file.


Part 4 — Gameplay Loop
Your game must be playable:
* Read user input (any format you define).
* Apply rules.
* Update the state.
* Display the updated board.
* Stop when one side has no ships remaining.
The bottom line: The player must be able to play Battleship through your terminal.


Part 5 — Bot Move Logic
You must implement a simple but intelligent bot with the following behavior:
5.1 Random Shooting
The bot initially picks random untested cells.
5.2 Smart Follow-up After First Hit
If the bot scores a hit and the ship is not size 1, then:
* It chooses one of the 4 adjacent cells (up/down/left/right) that is still available.
5.3 Axis Locking After a Second Hit
If the bot gets a second consecutive hit on the same ship and the ship is not size 2:
* Determine the orientation (horizontal or vertical).
* Continue searching only along that axis.
* It must check both directions, but cannot continue past misses or outside the board.
When the ship is destroyed:
* Bot returns to random mode.


README.md Requirements
Your report must include:
* How your input format works
* How you validate ship placements
* How you update and display the game state
* Any design decisions or trade-offs


Git Requirements
You must:
* Initialize a Git repository in the project root.
* Make at least one feature branch (e.g., feature/bot_ai).
* Do work there and merge it into main.
* Push the repository to GitHub.
* Submit only the GitHub URL.
